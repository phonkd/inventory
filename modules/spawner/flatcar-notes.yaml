# Flatcar Container Linux Configuration Notes

# Flatcar uses Ignition for provisioning instead of cloud-init
# The CAPI Kubeadm provider can generate Ignition configs for Flatcar

# Useful Flatcar features:
# - Automatic updates with update_engine
# - Docker/containerd pre-installed
# - Minimal, immutable OS designed for containers
# - No package manager (uses containers for everything)

# For Proxmox template preparation:
# 1. Download Flatcar image: https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/current/flatcar_production_qemu_image.img
# 2. Convert to qcow2 if needed: qcow2-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 flatcar_production_qemu_image.img flatcar.qcow2
# 3. Import to Proxmox as VM template
# 4. Add cloud-init drive (even though Flatcar uses Ignition, CAPI may need it)
# 5. Configure:
#    - Network device (virtio)
#    - SCSI controller (VirtIO SCSI)
#    - QEMU Guest Agent support
#    - Serial console

# The Kubeadm bootstrap provider will handle:
# - Generating Ignition configs
# - Installing Kubernetes components
# - Configuring kubelet
# - Setting up the cluster

# Network configuration is handled via DHCP by default
# Static IPs can be configured via Ignition if needed

# Default user: core
# SSH keys are injected via the KubeadmConfig users section
